# Ecommerce Kafka Exercise

## Features
- Create order
- "Detect Fraud on create order"
- "Send email"
- Log order and email actions

## Observations
The main objective of this repo was to practice:
- kafka concepts
- Generic serlialization and deserialization
- Modularization in java
- Create an architecture that is able to be used as microservices

That's  the reason you will see fraud detector service and email service is just a mock, there is no actual fraud detection.
