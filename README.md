# Ecommerce Kafka Exercise

## Features
- Services
  - Create User
  - "Fraud Detector"
  - Create Order
  - "Send Email"
  - Generate User Reports
  - Common Database
  - Common Kafka
    - Generic Message Producer/Consumer

## Observations
The main objective of this repo was to practice:
- Kafka concepts
- Modularization in java
- Good architecture for a scalable message oriented microservices

Since the main focus was to practice kafka, there are some "mocks" 
like the fraud service verification that shouldn't be considered 
as ready to a real application.
